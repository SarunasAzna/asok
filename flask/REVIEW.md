# Review

## Term 1

All in all, the task is solved nicely. There are some specific notes about Python and JavaScript in app/api/routes.py and app/frontend/templates/map2.html files respectively.

Some general notes:
- Your python coding style is rather nasty- you should use a python linter to tell you about compliance with [PEP 008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding standard. You can download python linter plugin to sublime text editor.
- You should use spaces instead of tabs for indentation. The editor can be configure to automatically add 4 spaces whenever you press *tab*.
